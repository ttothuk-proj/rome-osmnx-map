# rome-osmnx-map
An edited map of the Italian capital, using OSMnx street network library.

A 20 x 20 km map of Rome has been rendered by the use of [OSMnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx) library in Python. To achieve the final result some of the edges have been cut off. The text was added using Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom.
